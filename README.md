# Rätt Spår Assignment
This repository is used as the base for the assignment given during the hiring process at Rätt Spår.
You are expected to fork this repository.

All work is done in the backend and frontend folders, adding to the file structure provided by those two frameworks.

**Backend** contains the Rätt Spår framework for writing the REST API consumed by the frontend client. You are expected to add your
own files into the `backend/src` folder, but should not need to make changes to the `backend/src/framework` folder.

**Frontend** contains a basic vue-cli project using Typescipt, vuex and vue-router. You are expected to add your own components
and views to this project, and create a frontend client that communicates with the backend that is also part of this assignment.

**Assignment** contains a copy of the assignment PDF you should have already been given.
